        ## For the Developer
        **Response Guidelines:**
        - [ ] Review the question and determine if it can be answered with existing documentation
        - [ ] If it's a how-to question, provide step-by-step instructions
        - [ ] If it's about system capabilities, reference relevant code or documentation
        - [ ] If it reveals a gap in documentation, consider creating or updating docs
        - [ ] If it's actually a feature request or bug, suggest using the appropriate template
        - [ ] Be clear and avoid technical jargon since teachers may not be technical

        **Consider:**
        - Is this question likely to be asked by other teachers? (document the answer)
        - Does this reveal a usability issue that should be addressed?
        - Should this be handled as a separate issue type in the future?
